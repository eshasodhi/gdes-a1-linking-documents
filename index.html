    <h2>Hi, I'm Esha Sodhi.&#127775;</h2>
    <h3> I am a <strong>multidisciplinary designer</strong> with a deep curiousity about <strong>human behaviour</strong> and how it shapes interactions with space and design.</h3>
   
    <p>My foundation in <strong>architecture</strong> has established an iterative workflow, grounded in empathy for the user and tackling design problems through multi-scalar analysis, and research.</p>
    
    <p>I am all about detective design workâ€”digging into research, analyzing the layers, and turning the gems hidden in the details into creative visualizations that help bring the design to life.</p>
   
    <p>Through a blend of exploration, curiosity, critical thinking, and visual storytelling, I strive to design thoughtful, adaptive solutions that enhance how people experience and interact with their environments.</p>

    <h3><i>"Design not only responds to human needs, but actively constructs human conciousness"</i></h3>
    <b>[Columina & Wigley]</b></p>

    <p>This quote continually inspires me as it highlights the deep, profound impact our design decisions have on shaping not just our environments, digital or physical, but humanity itself. This challenge encourages us to ask questions, seek multi-layered understandings, and continuously evolve as we design.</p>
