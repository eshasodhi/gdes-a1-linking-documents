    <h2>About Me&#127774;</h2>

    <p>Hi, I am Esha—a designer and artist exploring how environments, technology, and people shape each other.</p>
    <p>I recently completed my <strong>Bachelor of Design in Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and Urbanism</strong> at UBC, where my work bridges research, critical inquiry, and creative practice</p>

    <h2>Experience-Oriented Approach&#129668;</h2>

    <p>I am continually discovering how the built environment can critically improve the well-being of human and non-human actors. Small, intentional gestures derived from the social, cultural, and ecological contexts can impact users in substantial ways.</p>

    <p>My projects often investigate themes of <em>cognition, sensory experience, and community</em>—from <a href="#neuro">NeuroLoom</a>, an installation that addresses “brainrot” and digital attention, to <b>PlotPair</b>, an app that connects neighbors through urban farming.</p>
    
    <p>I am especially drawn to <strong>participatory</strong> and <strong>experiential design</strong>, where audiences become collaborators and the boundaries between art, architecture, and interaction blur.</p>

    <h2>Exploratory Practice&#127912;</h2>

    <p>Beyond academics, I explore ideas through collage and digital art, using fragments of imagery and texture as a way to reflect on how our minds process information in pieces rather than as a whole.</p>
    
    <p>Much like in <a name="neuro">NeuroLoom</a>, where fleeting digital impressions are transformed into threads of thought, my collages attempt to slow down that rapid consumption and reframe it as something layered, reflective, and tactile.</p>
    
    <p>I am interested in how creative practices can act as experiments in perception—whether by overlapping images to suggest new narratives or by using digital layering to echo the overstimulation of contemporary life.</p>
    
    <p>Many of my works invite viewers to pause and consider what might otherwise be overlooked, turning noise into resonance. For me, making art is not only about creating objects but also about designing experiences that invite reflection and connection—whether in a gallery, a garden, or a shared kitchen table.</p>
